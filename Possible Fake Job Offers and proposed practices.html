    <TH>Identifying Fake Job offers</TH>
    <TH>Best Practices</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
    <TD>Job offers are generally published on some of the recruitment portals/social networking platforms rather on the official websites with no proper defined requirement and the with no specific domain expertise.</TD>
    <TD><b>Check for the authenticity:</b> Do an online search. Google the company, the employer, or the recruiter, and see what pops up. For example, if you get emailed a job offer from say from a random name claiming they’re a recruiter, search up their name online (or on LinkedIn) to see if their claim stands.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
    <TD>Recruiters offering very lucrative packages (hard to believe) irrespective of the experience and without even judging the technical competencies and abilities.</TD>
    <TD><b>Do not accept any job offers that pay unbelievable salary for no experience:</b> As we said before, a job that pays any decent amount of money will require a certain level of knowledge or experience in the field. So, if the job offer promises decent/easy money for an easy job, it’s probably a no-no.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
    <TD>Receive communication offering a job for which you never applied.</TD>
    <TD><b>Never accept an offer for something you didn’t apply:</b> Sometimes, scammers will contact you out of nowhere, saying you’re hired for a job that you didn’t apply for. This is, of course, a scam.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
    <TD>Offer the appointment letter very quickly without even mentioning the work details or the tasks to be carried out after joining the Organisation.</TD>
    <TD><b>Don’t complete any sort of formalities in a hurry:</b> A typical sign of a job scam is when the scammer urges you to act fast to “seal the deal” and give them your money or your personal information. A normal hiring process takes at least 1-3 weeks, depending on the company procedure. So, any employer who guarantees a super fast hiring process is guaranteed to be a scammer.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
    <TD>The recruiter mail communication will be through generic service provider like Gmail/Hotmail rather official mail server of their own.</TD>
    <TD><b>Connect with the company:</b> Did you see a job offer on social media supposedly from a company? Don’t take everything at face value. Shoot the company an email asking if the offer is legit or, at least, check the company’s website to see if the listing is there. If the job opening is real, it should definitely be on the website.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
    <TD>The employer may ask for some confidential information while interviewing like Bank account details/Credit Card Information etc.</TD>
    <TD><b>Do not provide your Bank account details to a potential employer:</b> Obviously, you will need to provide sensitive information such as your bank details to your employer eventually. However, no legit employer will ever ask for your bank details before you actually settle into the job.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
    <TD>The recruiter asking for some monetary deposits or asking for Financial aid/fund to buy any equipment or to run the organization/ May demand for some Non-refundable deposit towards application/registration fee.</TD>
    <TD><b>Avoid any Online financial transaction:</b> Wire transfers are common among thieves. They consist of moving money quickly from one account to another and it’s almost impossible to recover those funds. So, if you get an email supposedly from a company executive asking you to wire money for lack of an easier payment method, that’s your sign that it's a job scam.</TD>
